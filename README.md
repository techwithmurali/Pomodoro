Pomodoro Technique and Its Pythonic Implementation

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.
While Pomodoro timers are available in Mobiles smartwatches this program is an attempt to implement the same in desktop using Python.

Plyer module needs to be installed using pip. [pip install plyer]
